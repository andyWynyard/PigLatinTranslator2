# Pig Latin Translator

This project is a small, afternoon project that will take in text and output the result in pig latin. 

The project was developed with Andy Wynyard (andyWynyard) using the paired programming methodology.

A secondary project was grafted into the original pig latin translator to use the same interfaces to complete a word/line/character count on the Declaration of Independence (we decided to also translate that into pig latin since we had the tools at hand).
